      <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <p> This program just prints a flag in raw form. All we need to do is convert the output to hex and we have it! CLI yourself to /problems/963285fb64e4c5f7a31b5a601c704f99 and turn that Raw2Hex! </p>
      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> Google is always very helpful in these circumstances. In this case, you should be looking for an easy solution. </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> Another linux command I had heard of what it could do, but didn't know the syntax, but this one was paired with one I did know. The one I did know was cut. Specifically cut -d, which cuts the output by a delimeter, being ':'. So I used: "./raw2hex | cut -d ':' -f 2 | xxd -plain" Then I copied and pasted the flag, easy peas-y.</p>
