      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> All concepts required to complete this challenge, including simple modular math, are quickly found by googling :) </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> This one was more annoying than it was difficult. It felt like every time I went to go copy something back into the terminal, the nc would end. It was as simple as highlighting the prompt, copying it, pasting it into "www.asciitohex.com", and then copying that back into the terminal. Then for the finale, I simply took 32 (space) and added the remainder they wanted. Let's say the prompt was "give me a string that will result in a 15 after being transformed with the mentioned example hashing function." (add up sum of all values of all bytes and modulus 16). I would type '/' (32 + 15 = 47 -> '/') </p>
