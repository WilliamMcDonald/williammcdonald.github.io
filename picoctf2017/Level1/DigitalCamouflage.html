      <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <p> We need to gain access to some routers. Let's try and see if we can find the password in the captured network data: <a href="https://williammcdonald.github.io/picoctf2017/Level1/problemfiles/DigitalCamouflage/data.pcap" target=_blank> data.pcap. </a> </p>
      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> It looks like someone logged in with their password earlier. Where would log in data be located in a network capture? </p>
        <p> If you think you found the flag, but it doesn't work, consider that the data may be encrypted. </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> Digital Camouflage was the first challenge I tackled. It was probably the easiest I have faced at this point. All I did was I opened up the pcap in wireshark and looked for an entry that said "POST". I have had enough experience to realize that this is a login request. So I followed the TCP stream and found the password... encoded. I though it was a full on encryption, so I ran it through some of my decryption programs, to no avail. Props to my friend Seth for showing me that it wasn't an encryption, but just encoded in base 64.
