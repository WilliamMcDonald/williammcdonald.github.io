      <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <p> I heard you have some "delusions of grandeeur" about your typing speed. How fast can you go at shell2017.picoctf.com:51091? </p>
      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> Use the nc command to connect! </p>
        <p> I hear python is a good means (among many) to generate the needed input. </p>
        <p> It might help to have multiple windows open </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> This one was as simple as making a python script, changing a couple variables, running it, copy, paste and succeed. The script was just a for loop that looped the number of letters they needed, followed by the number they wanted. I copied that and pasted it in the terminal with time to spare. It was easy. </p>
