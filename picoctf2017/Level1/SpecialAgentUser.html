      <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <p> We can get into the Administrator's computer with a browser exploit. But first, we need to figure out what browser they're using. Perhaps this information is located in a network packet capture we took: <a href="https://williammcdonald.github.io/picoctf2017/Level1/problemFiles/SpecialAgentUser/data.pcap" target=_blank> data.pcap.</a> Enter the browser and version as "BrowserName BrowserVersion". NOTE: We're just looking for up to 3 levels of subversions for the browser version (ie. Version 1.2.3 for Version 1.2.3.4) and ignore any 0th subversions (ie. 1.2 for 1.2.0) </p>
      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> Where can we find information on the browser in networking data? Maybe try <a href="http://www.useragentstring.com./" target=_blank>reading up on user-agent strings</a>. </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> Special Agent User was a lot like Digital Camouflage. I did not use the same TCP Stream even though I had just finished Digital Camouflage, because I honestly didn't realize that the browser would show in there, I guess I didn't look hard enough. I searched for a "GET" tag in the info and found one right away. When I looked into it, I found what I was looking for right at the top: Firefox/25.0 ... except I didn't realize it. I don't remember exactly what the flag was, but I do remember how difficult it was to figure out the exact way it was supposed to be entered. </p>
