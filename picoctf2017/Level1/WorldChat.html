      <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <p> We think someone is trying to transmit a flag over WorldChat. Unfortunately, there are so many other people talking that we can't really keep track of what is going on! Go see if you can find the messenger at shell2017.picoctf.com:5026. Remember to use Ctrl-C to cut the connection if it overwhelms you! </p>
      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> There are cool command line tools that can filter out lines with specific keywords in them. Check out 'grep'! You can use the '|' character to put all the output into another process or command (like the grep process) </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> This one was also due to my knowlege of linux. I knew of, but had not used the grep command before this point. So I did a quick syntax search and found it was easier than I thought. The first command I did was: nc shell2017.picoctf.com 5026 | grep 'flag'. I was still overwhelmed, so I found a common occurence: the flags all had "of the flag" in them. All I did was quickly change that last little part so I had "nc shell2017.picoctf.com 5026 | grep 'of the flag'". And waited until I got all 8 pieces. This one was a little complicated, just because I had never used grep before. </p>
