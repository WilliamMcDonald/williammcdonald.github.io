      <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <p> I really need to login to this <a href="http://shell2017.picoctf.com:43393/" target="_blank"> website </a>, but the developer hasn't implemented login yet. Can you help? </p>
      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> Where does the password check actually occur? </p>
        <p> Can you interact with the javascript directly? </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> Even though I hadn't solved the rest of level 1, I figured I would get the Master Challenge out of the way. I got to the website and saw the button so I hit F12 and looked for the script. After I found '/static/client.js', I opened it up in another tab and started reading. I'm not all that well-versed in JS, but I could get by enough to see the function 'process_password'. I took the last line and replaved res with true, because I saw that it would put input as true, which would make the line 'var params = "pword_valid=" + input.toString();' mean 'var params = "pword_valid=true"'. Which I figured was good for me... it was, and I got the flag and continued on. </p>
