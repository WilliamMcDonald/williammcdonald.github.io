      <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <p> Turns out, some of the files back from Master Challenge 1 were corrupted. Restore this one <a href="https://williammcdonald.github.io/picoctf2017/problemFiles/MasterChallenge/file" target=_blank>file</a> and find the flag. Update 16:26 EST 1 Apr If you feel that you are close, make a private piazza post with what you have, and an admin will help out. The flag starts with the character z. </p>
      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> What file is this? </p>
        <p> What do you expect to find in the file structure? </p>
        <p> All characters in the file are lower case or nuberical. There will not be any zeroes. </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> This really stretched my capabilities. I had only briefly touched on file signatures in my entire computer science "career". I did know enough to know what to search for. I started off by opening the file in hexedit, and noticed that the signature was cut out and had X's in its place. Easy fix - or so I thought. I practically got to every type of file signature before I realized it was just a zip file. I felt like an idiot, but fixed it, and found the flag. </p>
