      <h3> Instructions </h3>
        <p> Someone got hacked! Check out some service's password hashes that were leaked at <a href="problemFiles/LeakedHashes/hashdump.txt" target=_blank>hashdump.txt</a>! Do you think they chose strong passwords? We should check... The service is running at shell2017.picoctf.com:30767! </p>
      <h3> Hints </h3>
        <p> See if you can crack any of the login credentials and then connect to the service as one of the users. What's the chance these hashes have actually already been broken by someone else? Are there websites that host those cracked hashes? Connect from the shell with nc. </p>
      <h3> Solution </h3>
        <p> This one was sadly all to familiar. I copied the hashdump into my own text file and got rid of the names, leaving only the hashes, and named this file <a href="problemFiles/LeakedHashes/hashdump-nonames.txt" target=_blank>hashdump-nonames.txt.</a> I opened the file and copied all of the hashes to my clipboard. I navigated to my trusty <a href="https://hashkiller.co.uk" target=_blank>hashkiller.co.uk</a> and used the md5 decrypter to get the password. I used the two files to match up what password went with which username. Then, I nc'd to shell2017.picoctf.com:30767 and entered the username and password.</p>
